# Python-Task-1
This Python code creates a simple Hangman game. The computer randomly selects a fruit name, and the user has to guess the letters. The user gets up to 6 wrong guesses. Correct guesses reveal parts of the word. The game ends when the user either guesses the word correctly or uses all attempts.
